       <span class="h3-light"> What was the first thing you paid attention to <br>when interacting with the experience?</span>
       <p><span class="p-light">What stood out to me first about this site was the captivating
         scrolling and hover effects. They was a variety of effects used to activate
         <br> and display different pieces of information, and the experience was very engaging. The animation elements were dynamic<br> and interesting, and I also greatly enjoyed the bold typographic design of the website, as it instantly
         <br> established a unique personality and professional impression of the site.

    <br>
    My most common action was scrolling, as I was directed on the landing page to do so. 
    There were also no obvious alternative user paths available. And once I received the feedback of more and more information appearing as I scrolled, it became an instinctive behaviour that required no second thought.

   <span class="h1-red">What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience? </span>
   <div class="row">
    <div class="column left"></div>
    <div class="column right"><span class="p-red">The goal of this digital exhibit is to showcase architect Frank Gehry’s process of designing the Walt Disney Concert Hall, and to engage and educate an audience on it through multimedia presentation.
    </span><br><br><br><br>
    <span class="h3-red">How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</span><br><br><br>
    <span class="p-red">The landing page writes “How Frank Gehry and his team designed a monument to music-the story of the Walt Disney Concert Hall”, and immediately establishes the context of the site. Once the user scrolls away from the landing page, they are greeted by a photo of the concert hall that moves as they continue scrolling. Having a visual representation of the context of the site, in this case the concert hall, helps to capture the user’s attention and enhance their understanding of what they are going to learn about.
    <br><br>
      The high quality visuals consisting of images, videos, and well-designed graphics makes the site feel like a professional and trustworthy source of information. This is important considering how the immersion and trust of the audience is likely to impact how much information they would walk away with.
    <br><br>
      Additionally, the experience is also carefully curated for viewers to focus on a single piece of information at a time: they can continue scrolling if they wish to move on to the next part, and they can stop scrolling if they need more time to process the information on screen at any time.

  <h3> What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)

  <div class="column right"><div id="fix-padding"><p>
    <br>
    My impression is that interacting with it once is sufficient for a viewer to digest all the important information that the site wishes to deliver. However, the website is a digital exhibit, and is designed for both long-term and short-term engagements. There may be people who wish to visit the site multiple times to review some of the informative architectural contents available on the site. These people could include architecture students, educators and enthusiasts.

  </h3></div>
  <div class="column right"><div id="fix-padding"><p>
    <br>
    While the site shows no indication that it encourages multiple visits, bringing the exhibition onto a digital platform such as this provides increased accessibility to the content as compared to a physical one. People are welcome to revisit the site as many times as they wish, but are not in obligated to do so.

  <div class="row">
      <div class="column left"></div>
      <div class="column right">
        <span class="p-lightBold">The digital exhibition is centred around the disciplines of architecture and classical music, tone of the site is very much rooted in appreciation of both. Making the title ‘Sculpted Harmony’ a perfect representation of what the site is about.
       <br><br>
       <span class="p-light">There is classical music playing in the background through almost the whole experience, as the users are immediately directed to turn their sound on when they arrive on the landing screen. This establishes the importance of music in the experience of the site. The grandiose music choices are ones that might be heard in the concert hall, and is a constant reminder of the context in which the site exists for.
        <br><br>
        In its characterisation, the site blends bold modern typography and organic brush strokes. The contrast of digital and traditional visual references is what makes the visuals so striking and memorable. The mix of sans-serif and serif typefaces is another example of contrasting elements used, and all these characterisation choices highlight how the concert hall was conceived through technical and creative concepts, and is one of a kind.

       <div class="column right">
        <span class="p-red">The way the site immediately highlights to the user ‘For the best experience, turn your sound on’ upon landing on the page establishes the audio as an integral part of the whole user experience of the site, and communicates that they should be listening to it for the best experience.
         <br><br>
         The text is also formatted in short sentences for better readability, so that users would be more likely to read all the contents on the site. Progress bars are displayed for all the video content to provide visual feedback for the users. Having a visual representation of their current progress and estimated completion time gives users a sense of control, and they would be more likely to watch the videos in their entirety. Improving the user experience in these two aspects improves engagement, which is key considering how the goal of the site is to effectively communicate the process of building the concert hall.

        <div class="column right"><span class="p-red">The fact that music is used at all is already a unique feature of the site, but the principle purpose of including grandiose classical music is to evoke feelings of excitement and inspiration from the audience. By creating greater emotional connection between the audience and the work being exhibited, they would likely walk away from the experience with a more lasting impression.
        <br><br>
          The hover interactions on the text elements can enhance enjoyment and interest for the users as well, and make the process of reading and watching information less monotonous.
          <br><br>
          The bold colours and typography creates a casual, creative and flexible environment for the users, and makes it more fun to learn about the content being exhibited.

          <br><br><br>
          <span class="p-green">One negative aspect of the experience was that it buffered and lagged at some points, and the initialisation process does take a few seconds, which probably could be attributed to the loading of all the effects on the website. But as a whole, the website performs without any problems.

          <span class="p-green">
            The most satisfying aspect of the site was the hover effects. There are a variety of hover effects implemented, and it makes interacting with the different elements very enjoyable. As some of the buttons were stylised to look like ordinary text with no background colour, the animation that appears as a hover effect provided the feedback to me that the texts have functionality. My favourite hover effect however, was the one used on the title text ‘Sculpting Harmony’ on the landing page. Words are triggered to appear one by one, following the position and movement of the cursor, and forms a sentence. I have never experienced an interaction like this before and thought it was amazing.
