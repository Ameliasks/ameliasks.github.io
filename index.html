       <h3><span class="h3-light"> What was the first thing you paid attention to <br>when interacting with the experience?</span></h3>
       <p><span class="p-light">What stood out to me first about this site was the captivating
         scrolling effects. They was a variety of effects used to activate<br> and display different pieces of information, and the experience was very engaging. The animation elements were dynamic<br> and interesting, and I also greatly enjoyed the bold and unique typographic design of the website, as it instantly<br> established a unique personality and professional impression.

 <div class="row">
  <div class="column left"><span class="h3-red">What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</span></div>
  <div class="column right"><span class="p-red">
    My most common action was scrolling, as I was directed on the landing page to do so. There are no obvious alternative user paths available. And once I saw the feedback of more and more information appearing as I scrolled, it became an instinctive behaviour that required no second thought.

It details the process from start to end, from both the creative and technical perspectives, and feels like a form of homage to both Gehry and to the concert hall.</span></div>
