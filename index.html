    <title>From Melbourne With Love</title>

    <!-- From Melbourne, with love. 
     My chosen context and action for assignment 3 is a digital scrapbook of photos 
     I have taken across Melbourne over the last year. Users can interact with some 
     photos by dragging them around and others by hovering over them to unveil 
     animations and/or descriptions. -->

    <!-- In this project, I will be using a mix of interactions that include drag, scroll and hover.
     I decided to implement these interactions as I wanted to make the interface fun and unpredictable
     for the user. Since the subjects of my photographs are ordinary, I hope that these
     interactions will elevate the interest of the users. -->

    <!-- The selection of photographs I have chosen are the ones that best capture what I like
     about living in Melbourne. The contradiction of busy streets and quiet spaces, clean and cluttered.
     This is also why I have chosen to make the landing page a little messy and random. -->

    <!-- The text that lies behind the draggable objects aims to work as a user learnability function 
      - abeit an abstract one. I have borrowed this tactic from everything.can.be.scanned (https://ecbscanned.com/)
      When interacting with that site, I realised that making the user curious to see the full title
      will teach them to move the images away to reveal it. Since I am not providing my user with any
      instruction, this is a subtle way I am hinting to them how they should be interacting with it. -->

    <!-- When the user hovers over any of the draggable elements, they will see the grab cursor, and
     that would hopefully hint to them that they are interactive. I have also created a function
     that will constantly overlay the images over one another when clicked, by constantly updating the z-index
     of their common css class. This is so the user has more flexibility to play around and customise their layouts.  -->

    <container>
      <p class="secret" id="secretText">
        if you find this, screenshot your layout :P
      </p>

      <!-- Over here I added a secret task for the user to screenshot the layout that they
       have customised. I hope that this will incentivise them to spend more time on the site
       playing around with the elements to create their own unique designs. Since I don't want
       this text to get in the way of their designs, I have created a function for it to disappear
       once the user hovers over it. -->

       would like the users to be able to focus on each photo with less distraction, I have included
       a fullscreen function when they click on the photograph. They can easily escape fullscreen mode
       by clicking anywhere else on the screen. I customised the cursor for these photographs to be the zoom-in cursor,
       so that the users know to click on it and trigger fullscreen mode. There is also a hover effect that turns each photo black and white, rotates it, and shows its caption.-->

      <!-- There are two elements with scroll animations: the payphone that moves straight downwards,
       and the coffee that floats downwards across the screen. These scroll animations aim to increase
       the time the user spends on the site by interacting with them. The coffee rotating across
       the screen might seem a little random and funny, but that is pretty much the point. I think
       creating this point of unexpectedness will make the site more interesting for the user. 
       And as this is Melbourne we are talking about, I think the coffee deserves the spotlight.
       The cursor for these elements have been set to not-allowed, so that the user will know that they
       cannot be dragged.-->

         This was achieved with window.addEventListener and the removal of getBoundingClientRect(), as I learnt the hard way when document.addEventListener
