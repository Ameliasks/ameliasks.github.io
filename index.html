     <!-- Context chosen: Video Art (Artist Website)-->
     <!-- I made up a title, artist name and synopsis for my fictional context. -->
     <!-- The artist's name is January Adams, and this is their portfolio website.  -->

     <!-- When I first watched the provided video, the psychedelic graphics and use of electronic dance music personally reminded me a lot of 2000s pop culture. I decided to lean into the abstract technology aesthetic from that era for my interface characterisation.
    In Adobe Photoshop, I designed a background artwork consisting of lines, geometric shapes, technological elements and screenshots from the video. -->
    <!-- The colour palette for this interface was inspired by the video itself. I colour-picked the magenta shade from the video, and added secondary colours like grey and pale blue which I thought complemeted the magenta well.  -->
  

    <!-- Navigation Section -->
    <!-- I placed the artist's logo on the left, and included navigation links typical of portfolio websites.-->
    <!-- I created hover effects for these links to simulate how they would look when the user interacts with them. -->

        <!-- When there are parts of the video art the user might want to have closer look at, or their experience is being interupted by external factors,having a button that allows them to pause the video playback would be very useful to them.  -->
        <!-- I added an autofocus to the play button, so that the user would be drawn to press it and initiate the video playback. -->
        <!-- To highlight the play button futher, I gave it a different gradient from the other two buttons, and also made it a little larger than the other buttons. -->
        <!-- I added a gradient for the buttons to emphasise the 2000s feeling of the interface. I also added a 'moving gradient' effect using the hover class and background position.-->
