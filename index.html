    <!-- When I first watched this video, the graphics and use of electronic dance music really reminded me of 2000s pop culture. I decided to lean into the abstract technology aesthetic and designed background that with that in mind.-->
    <!-- I designed the background image in Adobe Photoshop, and used screenshots from the video. -->

        <!-- When there are parts of the video art the user might want to have closer look at, or their experience is being interupted by external factors,
         having a button that allows them to pause the video playback iwould be very useful to them.  -->
         <!-- I added an autofocus to the play button, so that the user would be drawn to press it and initiate the video playback. -->
         <!-- To highlight the button futher, I gave it a different gradient from the other two buttons, and also made it a little larger than the other buttons. -->
        <!-- I added a gradient for the buttons to emphasise the y2k feeling of the interface. I also added a 'moving gradient' effect using the hover class and background position.-->
